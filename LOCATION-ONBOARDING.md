# Location Onboarding Playbook

A cold-start checklist for onboarding any US city to empowered.vote. Follows the Cambridge, MA proof-of-concept from v5.0.

**How to use:** Work through Steps 1–8 in order before writing any code or migrations. Each step has a decision log section — record your answers as you go. When a step is complete, check it off and move to the phase template linked at the end of the step.

> **Cambridge example annotations** appear throughout as blockquotes. They are examples, not defaults.

## Step 1: Government Structure Research

Before touching the database, confirm how the city government is structured.

### Required questions

- [ ] What is the form of government? (Strong Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, Commission, Town Meeting, other)
- [ ] List all elected offices: city council (ward-based, at-large, or mixed), school committee, mayor, other
- [ ] Is the Mayor directly elected by voters, or selected from within the council after the council election?
- [ ] If Mayor is council-selected: does the Mayor also hold a council seat, or is Mayor a separate role that replaces their council seat?
- [ ] Is there an appointed City Manager or Administrator? Who holds the position currently?
- [ ] Are there appointed positions that should appear in lookup results (City Attorney, City Clerk, etc.)?
- [ ] What are the current incumbents for each elected office (full legal names, term start dates)?
- [ ] Has the city's charter changed in the last 5 years? If yes, confirm the current structure from the official charter document — not Wikipedia.

### Schema decisions to record before migrating

| Decision | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| Form of government | |
| Mayor district_type | LOCAL or LOCAL_EXEC (use LOCAL if Mayor is not a separately-elected executive; use LOCAL_EXEC only if Mayor is the primary executive AND directly elected) |
| Mayor is_appointed_position | true or false |
| City Manager exists? | yes / no — if yes, is_appointed = true on politician row |
| School Committee elected seats | count |
| Council seats total | count |
| Ward-based, at-large, or mixed? | |

> **Cambridge example:**
> - Form of government: Council-Manager (Plan E)
> - Mayor district_type: LOCAL (NOT LOCAL_EXEC — Cambridge Mayor is NOT a separately elected executive; they are selected from within the 9-councillor body by the councillor who received the most first-choice votes)
> - Mayor is_appointed_position: true on the Mayor office row
> - City Manager: Yi-An Huang, is_appointed = true
> - School Committee: 6 elected seats (Mayor is NOT an automatic member under the 2025 charter — confirm the specific charter version before seeding)
> - Council seats: 9 at-large (no ward-based districts)

### Sources for government structure

1. Official city website — mayor's office, city council, city manager pages
2. City charter document (PDF from official city website)
3. MMA Data Hub (mma.org) — fastest cold-start for MA cities; check for your state's equivalent municipal association
4. Ballotpedia city page (check: many smaller cities are not covered)
5. DO NOT use Wikipedia as primary — it lags charter changes by months

---

## Step 2: Election System Confirmation

Confirm the election mechanics before seeding any election or race rows.

### Required questions

- [ ] What is the election method? (Plurality, Ranked-Choice/IRV, STV/Proportional Ranked-Choice, Runoff, other)
- [ ] Does your database `chambers` table have an `election_method` enum value for this method? (Run `SELECT constrname, consrc FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'essentials.chambers'::regclass AND contype = 'c';` to verify)
- [ ] Are elections held in odd-numbered years, even-numbered years, or off-cycle? (Do not assume even-year alignment with state/federal elections)
- [ ] When was the last municipal election? When is the next?
- [ ] Are municipal races partisan (party labels on ballot) or nonpartisan?
- [ ] Approximately how many candidates typically file per race? (Affects UI load testing requirements)
- [ ] For multi-seat races (council, school committee): how many seats per race?

### Schema decisions to record before migrating

| Decision | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| election_method enum value | |
| Does enum value exist in DB? | yes / no (add migration if no) |
| Last election date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Next election date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Partisan or nonpartisan? | |
| Candidate count per major race | ~N candidates |

> **Cambridge example:**
> - Election method: stv_proportional (Single Transferable Vote — Cambridge has used STV since 1941, the longest-running STV jurisdiction in the US)
> - Verify enum exists in DB before migrating — stv_proportional may not be in the constraint yet
> - Last election: November 4, 2025
> - Next election: November 2027 (Massachusetts law requires municipal elections in odd-numbered years — there is NO Cambridge city election in 2026; do not seed a 2026 date)
> - Nonpartisan (candidates have no party label on the ballot, though affiliations are widely known via endorsements)
> - Cambridge City Council 2025: 19 candidates for 9 seats
> - Cambridge School Committee 2025: 18 candidates for 6 seats
> - Warning: 37 total candidate cards on the elections page — pre-validate UI at this scale before seeding election data

**Critical:** Confirm the next election date from the city's election commission website, not from state-level sources. Many cities have off-cycle dates within their state's municipal calendar.

## Step 3: Geofence Sources

Identify what boundary data you need and where to get it.

### Required questions

- [ ] What is the city's GEOID? (7-digit Census place code — look up at census.gov or data.census.gov; do NOT use the county FIPS code)
- [ ] How many state senate districts split the city? (Test 3+ addresses spread across the city at malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator or your state's equivalent)
- [ ] How many state house districts split the city? (Same method — cities can be split by more districts than expected)
- [ ] How many congressional districts split the city?
- [ ] For TIGER boundaries: does `load-state-tiger-boundaries.ts` already allowlist this state? (Check `STATE_LAYER_ALLOWLIST` in `C:\EV-Accounts\backend\scripts\load-state-tiger-boundaries.ts`)
- [ ] Is a verification source available for state legislative boundaries? (e.g., MassGIS for MA, CalGIS for CA, Texas Legislative Council for TX)

### Schema decisions to record before migrating

| Decision | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| City geo_id (7-digit place code) | |
| County FIPS (5-digit, for G4020 congressional intersection) | |
| State senate district count covering city | |
| State house district count covering city | |
| Congressional district count covering city | |
| TIGER allowlist addition needed? | yes / no |
| Verification source URL for state districts | |

> **Cambridge example:**
> - City geo_id: 2511000 (NOT 25017 — that is Middlesex County; the county FIPS is a 5-digit code, the city place code is 7 digits)
> - Middlesex County FIPS: 25017 (needed for congressional G4020 intersection support)
> - State senate: 2 confirmed + 1 probable (Cambridge spans Second Middlesex + at least one additional — verify third by testing Cambridge Ward 1-7 addresses at malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator)
> - State house: 3 confirmed (24th Middlesex/Rogers, 25th Middlesex/Decker, 26th Middlesex/Connolly) + up to 3 partial edge districts
> - Congressional: 2 districts (MA-05 Clark + MA-07 Pressley — verify the split before seeding)
> - TIGER allowlist addition needed: yes — add `MA: new Set(['cd', 'sldu', 'sldl', 'place'])` to STATE_LAYER_ALLOWLIST in load-state-tiger-boundaries.ts
> - Verification source: MassGIS 2021 shapefiles (these ARE the current effective post-2020-redistricting boundaries despite the 2021 label); use malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator to spot-check at least 4 Cambridge addresses in different wards

**Warning:** Do not assume the city falls in a single house district. Dense urban cities are frequently carved across 4–6 districts.

## Step 4: Data Sources

Map out where you will get each type of data before starting any migration.

### Required questions

- [ ] City website: where are officials listed with names, titles, contact info? (Usually /departments/citycouncil or /government/elected-officials)
- [ ] Does the city use Cloudflare or other bot protection on contact pages? (If yes, email_address = NULL is acceptable; bio URL satisfies coverage target)
- [ ] State election authority: where are candidate filings and official results? (e.g., MA: sec.state.ma.us; TX: sos.state.tx.us; CA: sos.ca.gov)
- [ ] Is Ballotpedia coverage available for this city? (Check: many cities under ~150K population are not covered)
- [ ] Does an open data portal exist for this city? (Note: open data portals almost never contain officials or contact data — they contain service/operational data)
- [ ] For compass stances: what are the dominant policy issues? Where do candidates/officials go on record? (City council meeting minutes, local newspaper Q&As, LWV voter guides, candidate websites)
- [ ] For headshots: where are official photos? (Check official website members page, city council meeting recordings, local news archives)

> **Cambridge example:**
> - Officials: https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/citycouncil/members (primary); https://www.cpsd.us/school-committee (for school committee)
> - Cloudflare protection: NOT present for Cambridge city website; verify email format per member before seeding
> - State election authority: https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/elections/
> - Cambridge election results: https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/electioncommission
> - Ballotpedia: limited coverage for Cambridge (population ~118K; Ballotpedia threshold is roughly 200K for reliable coverage)
> - Open data portal: data.cambridgema.gov exists BUT contains permits, police logs, and service data only — does NOT have officials or contact information; do not waste time searching it for personnel data
> - Compass stances: public statements, city council meeting voting records (cambridgema.gov meeting minutes), local press (Cambridge Chronicle, Harvard Crimson for charter-related coverage)
> - Headshots: https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/citycouncil/members (official council photos); http://vote.cambridgecivic.com (volunteer civic site, useful as backup)
> - Campaign finance: MA OCPF (ocpf.us) — different format from LA Ethics Commission; do not assume FPPC/LA equivalents exist in other states

**Reminder:** LA data richness (LACBA attorney ratings, CJP judicial database, Ethics Commission campaign finance API) is an outlier, not a baseline. Do not plan phases around finding LA-equivalent sources for other cities.

## Step 5: Schema Decisions Before Migration

Make these decisions before writing any SQL. Wrong answers here corrupt the schema.

### Required questions

- [ ] geo_id confirmed? (7-digit Census place code — verified against TIGER or Census Bureau, not inferred from county FIPS)
- [ ] election_method enum value confirmed to exist in DB? (SELECT constrname, consrc FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'essentials.chambers'::regclass)
- [ ] Mayor office modeling decided: LOCAL vs LOCAL_EXEC, is_appointed_position true/false
- [ ] Are there any offices where the same politician holds two roles simultaneously? (e.g., Cambridge Mayor is simultaneously a City Councillor — one politician row, two office linkages)
- [ ] What name does the city officially use for the council chamber? ("City Council" vs "Town Council" vs "Board of Aldermen" etc.)
- [ ] What name does the city officially use for council members? ("Councillor" vs "Councilor" vs "Council Member" vs "Alderman")
- [ ] What is the government name? ("City of Cambridge" vs "Town of Cambridge" vs "Cambridge" — match exactly what the city uses on official documents)
- [ ] What is the next migration number? (Run `SELECT MAX(version) FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations;` via psql before writing any migration file)

> **Cambridge example:**
> - geo_id: 2511000 (confirmed against US Census official GEOID documentation)
> - election_method: stv_proportional — verify this value exists in the chambers table constraint before migrating; add it if missing
> - Mayor modeling: is_appointed_position = true; district_type = LOCAL; politician_id on Mayor office row points to Marc C. McGovern (who also holds a Councillor office row); no election race row for Mayor
> - Dual-office: Marc C. McGovern holds both a Councillor seat AND the Mayor title — seed ONE politician row for McGovern, then link that politician_id to BOTH office rows (the Councillor office and the Mayor office)
> - Council chamber name: "City Council"
> - Member title: "Councillor" (double-l — Cambridge official spelling; do not auto-normalize to "Councilor")
> - Government name: "City of Cambridge" (NOT "Cambridge, MA" or "Cambridge City")
> - Migration number: run the SQL check before writing; as of planning date, next is 111

## Step 6: Migration Order

Always migrate in this sequence. Skipping steps or migrating out of order creates broken foreign key references.

```
1. Geofences — state legislative + congressional + city place boundaries
   → TIGER loader run (load-state-tiger-boundaries.ts) OR manual shapefile import
   → Verify with FindMyLegislator or state equivalent before proceeding

2. Government row — one row in essentials.governments for this city
   → Confirm geo_id, state, name_formal before inserting

3. Chambers — one row per legislative/school/governing body
   → Confirm election_method enum exists before inserting
   → Confirm seat counts match official charter

4. Offices — one row per seat
   → At-large councils: N individual office rows, same title, no Place numbers (unless city uses Place numbers)
   → Ward-based councils: one office per ward/district
   → Mayor (if appointed): is_appointed_position = true
   → City Manager: is_appointed_position = true

5. Incumbents (politicians) — one row per person
   → Dual-role incumbents (e.g., Mayor who is also a Councillor): ONE politician row, linked to BOTH office rows
   → is_appointed = true for appointed positions
   → email_address only if verified from official source; NULL is acceptable

6. Elections + race_candidates
   → Confirm election date from election commission (not assumed from state cycle)
   → For historical/completed elections: seed as completed with all race_candidates
   → For future elections: seed as upcoming placeholder; do not activate discovery until filing opens

7. Headshots
   → 600×750 JPEG, Lanczos resize, 4:5 ratio (crop first, then resize — never distort)
   → Upload to Supabase Storage via existing headshot upload pattern
   → No banners, text, or graphics over face

8. Compass stances (optional, do after officials are stable)
   → Research one politician at a time (rate limit rule)
   → Citation required for every stance
   → Apply via existing apply-*.ts ingest pattern
```

> **Cambridge migration order:**
> - Phase 38 (MA Geofences) runs first — no DB dependencies
> - Phase 39 (MA Government DB) starts after Phase 38 completes (district rows must exist before politicians link to them)
> - Phase 41 (Cambridge City Structure) depends on Phase 39
> - Phase 42 (Cambridge Headshots) depends on Phase 41
> - Phase 43 (Cambridge Elections) depends on Phase 41 + Phase 38
> - Discovery pipeline configured in Phase 43 but left INACTIVE until 2027 filing opens

## Step 7: Common Pitfalls (Check Before Every Migration)

These mistakes have been made on prior cities. Check this list before writing each migration.

| Pitfall | How to Catch It |
|---------|----------------|
| Mayor modeled as LOCAL_EXEC when actually council-selected | Verify: does the Mayor appear on the ballot as a standalone race? If no — use LOCAL + is_appointed_position = true |
| Wrong geo_id (county FIPS instead of city place code) | City geo_id = 7 digits (SSCCCCC format); county = 5 digits (SSCCC) |
| Wrong election year (even vs. odd) | Check election commission — do not assume even-year alignment with state elections |
| Assuming single house/senate district when city spans multiple | Test 3+ addresses spread across city with FindMyLegislator before seeding geofences |
| Missing charter amendments | Charter changes can remove or add offices (e.g., Cambridge 2025 removed Mayor as automatic School Committee member) |
| Open data portals mistaken for officials source | Open data portals contain operational data, not personnel data |
| LA-specific sources assumed available | Bar ratings, judicial databases, Ethics Commission APIs are California-specific — verify source availability per state |
| Councillor vs. Councilor spelling | Match the city's official spelling exactly; do not normalize |
| Email addresses guessed from patterns | Only seed emails verified from official city website at time of seeding; NULL is acceptable |
| Discovery cron firing on far-future election | Mark discovery_jurisdictions row inactive until filing period opens |
| slug in chamber INSERT | slug is a GENERATED column on essentials.chambers — never include in INSERT statements |
| Partisan/nonpartisan assumption | Confirm explicitly — some US cities run partisan local races |

---

## Step 8: Phase Templates

Use these templates when writing GSD plan files for each phase type. Templates are in `.planning/templates/`:

- [`db-foundation.md`](.planning/templates/db-foundation.md) — New government row, chambers, offices setup
- [`officials-seed.md`](.planning/templates/officials-seed.md) — Seeding incumbents with contact data
- [`headshots.md`](.planning/templates/headshots.md) — Photo collection and upload
- [`discovery-setup.md`](.planning/templates/discovery-setup.md) — Discovery pipeline configuration
- [`compass-stances.md`](.planning/templates/compass-stances.md) — Stance research and ingestion

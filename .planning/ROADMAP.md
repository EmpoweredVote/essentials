## Backlog

These are known gaps that are not yet scoped into a milestone. They should inform future milestone planning.

### Race Completeness Audit (high priority)

**Problem:** There is no systematic way to detect missing races. The candidate discovery pipeline finds candidates for races that already exist in `essentials.races`, but does not surface races that are on an official ballot but absent from the DB. Gaps are only discovered by chance (e.g. noticing a high-profile race is missing).

**Why it matters:** An LA Mayor race was missing despite LA City Attorney, LA City Controller, and all City Council districts being present. The only reason it was caught is that a team member lives in LA. There is no visibility into what else might be missing for jurisdictions we are less familiar with.

**What the fix looks like:** A race audit tool that, for a given election, fetches the authoritative candidate filing list (LA City Clerk, California SoS, etc.) and diffs it against `essentials.races` — surfacing offices on the official ballot that have no race row in the DB. This is distinct from candidate discovery; it answers "what races are we missing?" not "what candidates are we missing?"

**Possible implementation:** A new admin endpoint or script that takes an election_id, hits the relevant official source, and returns a list of unregistered races. Could be Claude-powered (same pattern as candidate discovery) or a direct scrape.

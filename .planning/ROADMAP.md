### 🚧 v2.2 Data Depth & Admin Tooling (Parked — resume after v3.0)

**Milestone Goal:** Surface data gaps proactively, make compass work for local politicians, and give admins the tools to manage discovery without touching the terminal.

#### Phase 8: Admin Discovery UI + Dashboard
**Goal**: Admins can manage discovery runs and monitor coverage health entirely from the admin UI — no curl, no terminal
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: ADMUI-01, ADMUI-02, ADMUI-03, DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Admin can see all discovery_jurisdictions rows in the UI with name, election date, last run status, and last run timestamp
  2. Admin can trigger a discovery run for any jurisdiction by clicking Run Discovery and sees a spinner while the run is in progress
  3. Admin can view the full discovery run history with per-run stats (jurisdiction, date/time, candidates found, staged, auto-upserted, status)
  4. Admin can see per-jurisdiction coverage health showing total races, races with candidates, and races with zero candidates
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01-PLAN.md — Migration 083 + persist autoUpserted in discoveryService.ts
- [ ] 08-02-PLAN.md — Backend GET endpoints (jurisdictions, runs, coverage) on JWT-gated router
- [ ] 08-03-PLAN.md — DiscoveryDashboard.jsx page + adminApi helpers + /admin/discovery route
- [ ] 08-04-PLAN.md — Human-verify checkpoint for end-to-end UI flow

#### Phase 9: Race Completeness Audit
**Goal**: Admins can detect races that exist on the official ballot but are missing from the database, without writing SQL
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: AUDIT-01, AUDIT-02, AUDIT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Admin can trigger a race completeness check for a given election from the admin UI
  2. The audit result lists office names that appear on the official ballot but have no matching row in essentials.races, each with a source citation
  3. Admin can view completeness audit output in the admin UI without any terminal access or SQL
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01: Race audit backend — fetch authoritative ballot, diff against essentials.races, return missing offices with citations
- [ ] 09-02: Race audit admin UI — trigger + results display

#### Phase 10: Compass Stances Integration
**Goal**: The political compass renders correctly for local politicians (LA County + Monroe County) whose stances come from research files rather than pre-existing inform.politicians records
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: STANCE-01, STANCE-02, STANCE-03, STANCE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each essentials.politicians record with a stance research file is linked to an inform.politicians record (created if not exists)
  2. Stance values from research files (1-5 scale) are inserted into inform.politician_answers for all covered compass topics
  3. The political compass renders correctly on politician pages for LA County and Monroe County politicians sourced via the discovery pipeline
  4. Admin can run stance ingestion for a batch of politicians from the admin UI without manual SQL or terminal access
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: Essentials-to-inform bridge — schema mapping, upsert logic for inform.politicians + inform.politician_answers
- [ ] 10-02: Stance file ingestion — convert research file values, batch ingest ~25 politicians, admin trigger UI

#### Phase 11: Indiana Local Races
**Goal**: Monroe County local races (Commissioner, Clerk, Assessor, Township) are seeded and kept current by the discovery pipeline
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: INDIANA-01, INDIANA-02, INDIANA-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Monroe County local races (Commissioner, Clerk, Assessor, Township) appear in essentials.races with the correct May 5 2026 Indiana Primary election_id
  2. Candidates for those races appear in essentials.race_candidates with designations and source
  3. Monroe County appears in discovery_jurisdictions with the county clerk source URL so the weekly cron will keep it current
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: Monroe County local races seed + discovery_jurisdictions registration

### 🚧 v4.0 Compass Experience (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Turn the compass from an opt-in checkbox into the primary experience for calibrated users — Local Lens preset, mini compasses on every candidate tile, hover modals, and synchronized global controls.

#### Phase 33: Local Lens State System
**Goal**: CompassContext supports a Local Lens toggle that snapshots + restores user state and applies a curated 8-topic preset to all compasses simultaneously
**Requirements**: LENS-01, LENS-02, LENS-03, LENS-04, LENS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `toggleLocalLens()` switches `localLensActive` from false → true and back
  2. When activated, all CompassCard/CompassCardVertical instances see the 8 LOCAL_LENS_TOPICS as their topic set
  3. When deactivated, the exact prior `selectedTopics` and `invertedSpokes` are restored
  4. Refreshing the page with lens active keeps it active (localStorage persisted)
  5. Refreshing with lens inactive restores the pre-lens state correctly
**Plans**: TBD

#### Phase 34: Mini Compass Tile Component
**Goal**: Candidate tiles in compass mode show a mini RadarChartCore (no labels) sized to fill the tile's right-side space, with a Local Lens icon and the 3-spoke minimum/fallback algorithm
**Requirements**: MINI-01, MINI-02, MINI-03, MINI-04, MINI-05, MINI-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Candidate tiles with ≥3 overlapping bilateral answers show a mini compass in the right-side space without spoke labels
  2. Candidate tiles with <3 overlapping answers show no compass (silently absent, no error state)
  3. Preferred spokes missing bilateral answers are replaced from the scoped pool (same algorithm as CompassCard.jsx)
  4. Green magnifying-glass icon visible in each mini compass top-right; green when Local Lens active, dim when off
  5. Clicking the icon on any tile toggles global `localLensActive` and all visible mini compasses update
**Plans**: TBD

#### Phase 35: Hover Modal — Full Compass
**Goal**: Hovering a mini compass reveals a floating modal with a full titled RadarChartCore, legend, Local Lens icon, and Min/Max controls
**Requirements**: MODAL-01, MODAL-02, MODAL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Hovering over a mini compass opens a FloatingPortal containing a full compass with spoke title labels
  2. Modal shows a two-color legend (user shape + candidate shape), the Local Lens icon, and Min/Max buttons
  3. Moving the mouse off the compass (and modal) dismisses the modal without requiring a click
  4. Min/Max and Lens actions inside the modal update global state and are immediately reflected in all mini compasses on the page
**Plans**: TBD

#### Phase 36: Global Controls Bar + Compass-Default Mode
**Goal**: A global Min/Max + Local Lens control bar appears above the elections/reps list for all calibrated users; calibrated users default to compass mode on Elections and Results pages without needing to check a checkbox
**Requirements**: CTRL-01, CTRL-02, DEFAULT-01, DEFAULT-02, DEFAULT-03, DEFAULT-04, DEFAULT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A compass controls bar (Min/Max + Local Lens toggle) renders above the elections/reps list when compass mode is active
  2. Calibrated users (≥1 answer) arrive at `/elections` and see compass tiles immediately — no checkbox interaction
  3. Same default on Results page Elections tab and Representatives tab
  4. Uncalibrated users see the existing PoliticianCard (horizontal) view with no change
  5. `/elections` and Results Elections tab are in feature parity for all compass interactions
**Plans**: TBD

## Backlog

These are known gaps that are not yet scoped into a milestone.

### Data Gaps (accounts team backlog)

- CA Governor challenger candidates (10 filed, not yet seeded)
- LAUSD sub-district geofences pending
- lavote.gov election ID changes each cycle — mandatory manual update per election cycle
